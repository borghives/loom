### Analysis of the Current Implementation

The module provides three key components:
1.  **`PerfTimer` class:** A context manager for timing code blocks. It supports hierarchical timing by creating sub-timers, which is a great feature. The `__str__` method provides a human-readable summary with automatic unit scaling (s, ms, us).
2.  **`timed` decorator:** A convenient wrapper to time entire functions. It cleverly integrates with the `PerfTimer` hierarchy by checking for a `ptimer` keyword argument, allowing decorated functions to be part of a larger timing session.
3.  **`sub_timed` helper:** A small utility to safely create sub-timers from a potentially `None` parent timer, which simplifies client code.

Overall, the design is good, promoting ease of use for both ad-hoc timing and more structured performance analysis.

### Brainstorming & Enhancement Plan

Here is a proposed plan, moving from a critical correctness fix to reporting enhancements and then new features.

#### **Phase 1: Correctness and Reporting Enhancements**

This phase focuses on fixing a subtle bug and making the output more insightful.

1.  **Correct Timer `stop()` Logic:**
    *   **Thinking:** The current `PerfTimer.stop` method recursively calls `stop()` on all its children. This is redundant and conceptually incorrect. In a `with` statement, each child timer's `__exit__` method already ensures its own `stop()` is called. The parent's `stop` should only be responsible for its own measurement.
    *   **Plan:** Remove the loop `for child in self.child_timers.values(): child.stop()` from the `PerfTimer.stop` method.

2.  **Improve Reporting Readability and Detail:**
    *   **Thinking:** The current print output is good but can be made much easier to parse visually, especially for deep hierarchies. Adding relative percentages would also provide immediate insight into what parts of the code are most expensive.
    *   **Plan:**
        *   Modify the `__str__` method to generate a more distinct tree-like structure (e.g., using box-drawing characters like `├──` and `└──`).
        *   When printing child timers, calculate and display their duration as a percentage of their parent's total time. This is invaluable for identifying bottlenecks.
        *   Introduce a separate `report()` method on `PerfTimer`. This would allow a user to run a whole block of code and then print a single, consolidated report from the root timer at the very end, rather than having verbose output printed intermittently as each timer stops.

#### **Phase 2: Advanced Features**

This phase adds significant new capabilities to the module.

1.  **Asynchronous Support:**
    *   **Thinking:** The current `timed` decorator does not work with `async def` functions because it's not an `async` function itself. As modern Python relies heavily on `asyncio`, supporting it is crucial.
    *   **Plan:** Update the `timed` decorator to detect if it's wrapping a coroutine function. If so, the wrapper itself should be `async` and `await` the function's execution within the timing context.

2.  **Structured Data Export:**
    *   **Thinking:** The `__str__` output is for humans. For automated analysis, comparing performance across different runs, or generating visualizations (like flame graphs), a structured data format is needed.
    *   **Plan:**
        *   Create a `to_dict()` method on `PerfTimer` that recursively serializes the timer and its children into a dictionary.
        *   This dictionary would contain the name, total time, count, and a list of children dictionaries, creating a complete, machine-readable representation of the timing hierarchy.

#### **Phase 3: Ergonomics and Usability**

This phase focuses on making the tool even easier to use in large or complex codebases.

1.  **Global Timer Registry (Optional):**
    *   **Thinking:** Passing the `ptimer` object through many layers of function calls can be cumbersome. A global, context-aware timer could simplify this.
    *   **Plan:**
        *   Investigate using Python's `contextvars` to manage a stack of active `PerfTimer` instances.
        *   A user could start a global timer at the entry point of their application.
        *   The `timed` decorator could then be modified to automatically look for an active timer in the context, removing the need to explicitly pass the `ptimer` argument in most cases.
