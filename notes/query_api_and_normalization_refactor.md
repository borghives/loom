# Analysis of Query API and Normalization Refactoring (v2.6.0)

This document provides a detailed analysis of the changes in version 2.6.0. The changes introduce a significant refactoring of the query-building API and the query value normalization mechanism.

## 1. Summary of Changes

The staged changes introduce two major, interconnected improvements:

1.  **New Model-Centric Query API**: The generic `fld("field_name")` helper function has been deprecated and replaced by a new, model-centric API accessed via a `Model.fields()` class method.
2.  **Refactored Normalization Logic**: The responsibility for normalizing query values (e.g., upper-casing a string) has been moved from a centralized, brittle parsing mechanism into the new query-building objects themselves, making the process more robust and cohesive.

These changes correspond to a version bump from `2.5.2` to `2.6.0`, indicating the introduction of new features.

## 2. The New Query API: `Model.fields()`

The primary user-facing change is the removal of the `fld` helper in favor of a more explicit and discoverable query-building pattern.

### Previous Method (using `fld`):

```python
from loom.info import fld

my_filter = fld("age") > 30
```

### New Method (using `Model.fields()`):

```python
from my_app.models import User

# Explicit, discoverable
fields = User.fields()
my_filter = fields['age'] > 30
```

### Implementation Details

-   A new `Model.fields()` class method provides a `ModelFields` object that acts as a dictionary-like container for the model's fields.
-   Accessing a field (e.g., `fields['age']`) returns a `QueryableField` instance, which is responsible for creating `Filter` expressions.
-   The old `fld` helper has been removed from the library's public API.

### Benefits

-   **Discoverability**: The query mechanism is now an explicit part of the `Model` API (`User.fields()`), making it easier for developers to find and use.
-   **Readability**: Queries are more self-documenting as they are clearly associated with the model they apply to.

## 3. Refactoring of Query Value Normalization

The mechanism for normalizing query inputs has been fundamentally redesigned to be more robust and maintainable.

### Previous Method (Centralized Parsing):

Previously, `LoadDirective` used a set of complex parsing functions (`parse_agg_pipe`, `parse_filter_recursive`) to traverse the raw query dictionary and apply normalization rules defined in the model's metadata. This approach was:
-   **Brittle**: It could fail if it encountered a MongoDB operator it didn't recognize.
-   **Complex**: The logic for traversing the query structure was difficult to maintain.
-   **Not Transparent**: Normalization happened "magically" just before execution, far from where the filter was defined.

### New Method (Integrated into `QueryableField`):

The normalization logic has been moved directly into the `QueryableField` class.

-   When a comparison is made (e.g., `fields['name'] == 'john'`), the `QueryableField` instance first calls its internal `normalize_query_input` method on the value (`'john'`).
-   This method inspects the field's Pydantic metadata for `NormalizeQueryInput` transformers and applies them.
-   The normalized value is then used to construct the `Filter` object.

### Benefits

-   **Robustness**: This object-oriented approach is much more resilient. Each `QueryableField` handles its own normalization, eliminating the need for a fragile, centralized parser.
-   **Simplicity & Maintainability**: The complex parsing functions in `loom/info/directive.py` have been completely removed, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
-   **Cohesion**: Normalization logic is now tightly coupled with the field it belongs to, making the system's behavior easier to understand and reason about.

This change was inspired by the problem described in `notes/query_normalization_improvement.md`. While the original proposal suggested a different implementation, the final design achieves the same goals of robustness and simplicity by. The note itself was updated to reflect this new direction.

## 4. Conclusion

The staged changes for v2.6.0 represent a significant step forward in the usability and robustness of the `loom` library's query interface. By replacing the generic `fld` helper with a model-centric API and refactoring the normalization logic, the library is now easier to use, less prone to error, and more maintainable.
