# Loom

Weaves the fabric of information and time into one reality.

## North Star
A tapestry to which ideas are carried into reality swiftly, safely, and simply.  The two most important concept for such reality is information and time.

## Goal
- Lower mental load of coding
- Create friction for writing unsafe code for two of the hardest concept information management and time
    - a developer can always write themselves into a deep pit.  Let do our best to make that harder
- Nice simple code.
    - willing to sacrifice capability for simpler code.  For example we might forever support only ONE database (mongodb). 
    - Feel free to clone to another Loom to support another database paradigm.  Since most likely the will complicate our code and increase the mental load of two different information management concept

## Non Goal / Anti Goal
This is not intended as a swiss army knife of coding framework.  The Loom capability will grow as needs grow.  Our tenet is to not over implement until needs arise.

## Information

Initial limitation for simplicity:
- support only local and remote mongodb database
- cloud secret are access through google-cloud-secret-manager
    - this can be easily extended to other cloud secret manager (Not yet implemented)


## Time
