# Loom

Weaves ideas and concept using information and time construct.  

This is my way to frame it.  It is not the right way nor is it the only way, just simply a way I find helpful.
## Philosophy

-   **Lower mental load**: Abstract away boilerplate and repetitive tasks, letting developers focus on logic.
-   **Promote simple, elegant code**: Prioritize clarity and simplicity over exhaustive features. We are willing to sacrifice capability for a simpler, more focused codebase. For example, Loom is intentionally built only for MongoDB to avoid the complexity of supporting multiple database paradigms.  It is unlikely that it can support any other database and still be simple.
-   **Make the safe way the easy way**: The framework should guide developers away from common pitfalls, especially in data and time management.  Create coding friction for unsafe practices. But does not exhaustively build out guardrail if it comes at the cost of simplicity.

## Philosophy in Action

Hereâ€™s how Loom's code reflects its core philosophy:

| Goal | Feature | How It Works |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lower Mental Load** | **Declarative Persistence** (`Persistable`, `@declare_persist_db`) | Instead of writing database logic, you declare persistence by adding a mixin and a decorator to your Pydantic model. The framework handles the rest. |
| | **Automatic Timestamps & IDs** (`TimeInserted`, `TimeUpdated`) | Common fields like `_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_time` are managed automatically through type annotations, reducing boilerplate and potential errors. |
| **Friction for Unsafe Code** | **Forced Secret Management** (`get_remote_db_client`) | The system requires a secret for remote database connections, preventing insecure configurations from the start. |
| | **Fluent Query API** (`Aggregation`, `Filter`) | Building queries with a structured, chainable API (`.Match()`, `.Group()`, etc.) is safer and less error-prone than writing raw MongoDB dictionaries. |
| **Simple, Elegant Code** | **Focused Design** | By targeting only MongoDB, the entire information management system remains lean, consistent, and easy to understand. |

## Information Management

The core of Loom's information management is a declarative persistence layer built on top of Pydantic and MongoDB.

### Quick Start

Getting started with Loom is simple. Define your model, decorate it, and start interacting with the database.

```python
from loom.info.persist import Persistable, declare_persist_db
from loom.info.load import Filter

# 1. Define a Pydantic model and make it Persistable
# The `_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_time` fields are handled automatically.
@declare_persist_db(db_name="my_app", collection_name="users")
class User(Persistable):
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int

# 2. Create and save a new user
new_user = User(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com", age=30)
new_user.persist()
print(f"Saved user with ID: {new_user.id}")

# 3. Load a user from the database using its ID
retrieved_user = User.from_id(new_user.id)
if retrieved_user:
    print(f"Found user: {retrieved_user.name}")

# 4. Update the user's age
retrieved_user.age = 31
retrieved_user.persist()
print(f"User's updated time: {retrieved_user.updated_time}")

# 5. Load multiple users with a filter
active_users = User.load_many(Filter.from_arg(age={"$lt": 40}))
print(f"Found {len(active_users)} active users.")

# 6. Create another user to persist multiple documents at once
another_user = User(name="Bob", email="bob@example.com", age=25)
User.persist_many([new_user, another_user])
```

### Core Concepts

-   **`Model` & `Persistable`**: Your data models inherit from `loom.info.model.Model` and mix in `loom.info.persist.Persistable`. This gives them database-aware capabilities.
-   **`@declare_persist_db`**: A class decorator that links your model to a specific MongoDB database and collection. It keeps your persistence logic clean and co-located with your data definition.
-   **Specialized Persistence Models**:
    -   **`LedgerModel`**: For append-only data. Every `persist()` call creates a new document, ensuring an immutable history.
    -   **`TimeSeriesLedgerModel`**: Extends `LedgerModel` for use with MongoDB's native time-series collections, configured with the `@declare_timeseries` decorator.
-   **Fluent API for Queries**: `Aggregation`, `Filter`, and `SortOp` provide a structured, chainable API to build complex database operations without writing raw MongoDB queries, making your code more readable and maintainable.
-   **Rich Querying and Loading**: Beyond simple `load_one` and `load_many`, Loom provides `load_latest`, `from_id`, `exists`, and a powerful `aggregate` method for complex data retrieval, including loading data directly into a pandas `DataFrame` with `load_dataframe`.
-   **Bulk Operations**: Use `persist_many` and `insert_dataframe` to efficiently save multiple model instances or a whole pandas DataFrame at once.

### Automatic Field Behaviors

Loom uses Python's `Annotated` type to attach special behaviors to your model fields, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistency.

-   **`TimeInserted` & `TimeUpdated`**: Automatically manage `created_at` and `updated_time` timestamps. `TimeInserted` is set once on creation, and `TimeUpdated` is refreshed on every `persist()` call.
-   **`StrUpper` & `StrLower`**: Automatically normalize string fields to uppercase or lowercase.
-   **`IncrCounter`**: An integer type for atomic increments. Use the `+=` operator on the field, and Loom will translate it into an `$inc` operation in the database.

### Initial limitations for simplicity:
- Support for MongoDB only.
- Secret management is handled via `google-cloud-secret-manager`, local `keyring`, or environment variable.

## Time Management

Loom provides a structured way to reason about time through `TimeFrame` objects, which represent discrete, human-understandable intervals.

### Core Concepts

-   **`TimeFrame`**: The base class for all time frames. It defines a `floor` (inclusive) and a `ceiling` (exclusive).
-   **Resolutions**: Loom provides concrete `TimeFrame` implementations for common resolutions: `HourlyFrame`, `DailyFrame`, `WeeklyFrame`, `MonthlyFrame`, `QuarterlyFrame`, and `YearlyFrame`.
-   **Timezone Aware**: Time frames are timezone-aware, defaulting to UTC but easily configurable for any timezone.

### Quick Start

```python
from loom.time.timeframing import DailyFrame, WeeklyFrame
from loom.time.util import EASTERN_TIMEZONE

# Get the current daily frame in US/Eastern time
today_eastern = DailyFrame(tzone=EASTERN_TIMEZONE)
print(f"Today (ET): {today_eastern.get_pretty_value()}")
print(f"Floor: {today_eastern.get_floor()}")
print(f"Ceiling: {today_eastern.get_ceiling()}")

# Get the previous frame
yesterday_eastern = today_eastern.get_previous_frame()
print(f"Yesterday (ET): {yesterday_eastern.get_pretty_value()}")

# Get the weekly frame for a specific moment
weekly_frame = WeeklyFrame(moment=yesterday_eastern.floor)
print(f"Weekly Frame: {weekly_frame.get_pretty_value()}")
```

## Fabric: A Time-Aware Toolkit

The Fabric layer provides higher-level components for building applications that reason about events over time.

-   **`Moment`**: A core `Persistable` model that represents a single, timestamped event or data point, identified by a `symbol`.
-   **`MomentWindow`**: A container for a sequence of `Moment` objects, sorted by time. It provides powerful methods for analysis, such as:
    -   `sliding_window(size)`: Yields consecutive windows of a fixed number of moments.
    -   `sliding_time_cone(past_size, future_size)`: Yields a tuple of (past_window, future_window), ideal for creating training data for predictive models.
-   **`insight` Toolkit**: A collection of Pydantic models for performing statistical analysis on time-series data.
    -   **`Spread`**: Calculates percentiles, standard deviation, and mean.
    -   **`Regression`**: Performs linear regression to find the slope and statistical significance of a trend.
    -   **`PdfValue`**: Uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to find the most likely value (peak) and confidence interval of a dataset.
    -   **`Trending`**: A composite model that combines `Spread`, `Regression`, and `PdfValue` for a comprehensive trend analysis.
